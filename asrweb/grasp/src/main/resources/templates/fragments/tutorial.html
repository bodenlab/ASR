                    <p>The first thing you'll notice about GRASP is how simple it is to run. GRASP requires only two input files and one parameter to run successfully. The two files you will require are a set of (aligned) sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree.</p>
                    <p>GRASP accepts the following file formats.</p>
                    <table class="table">
                        <thead><tr>
                            <th>Sequences</th>
                            <th>Alignment</th>

                    <p>On the input form of GRASP, one of the options is to run test data (see <a href="#home-img">(1)</a>). This will automatically load an alignment file and tree file, and run joint reconstruction allowing you to explore the results provided by GRASP. As we proceed through this tutorial, we will refer to the results of this test data.</p>
                    <h3 id="Help">Help<a class="anchor-link" href="#Help"></a></h3>
                    <p>If, at any stage, you require specific information about what you are seeing presented on the GRASP home or results page, you can hit the help button to switch on help boxes (see <a href="#home-img">(8)</a>).</p>
                    <h3 id="Name-your-Job">Name your Job<a class="anchor-link" href="#Name-your-Job"></a></h3>
                    <p>To allow you to keep track of your results, on the GRASP landing page you are able to provide a name for your job  (see <a href="#home-img">(2)</a>). This name will be used as an identifier in any saved output data.</p>
                    <h3 id="Sequence-alignment">Sequence alignment<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sequence-alignment"></a></h3>
                    <p>Once you have a name, you can 'Select sequence alignment file..' (see <a href="#home-img">(3)</a>). Accepted alignment formats are noted in the table above.</p>
                    <h4 id="Align-using-GRASP">Align using GRASP<a class="anchor-link" href="#Align-using-GRASP"></a></h4>
                    <p>If you do not have a set of aligned sequences nor a corresponding phylogenetic tree, GRASP can align your sequences for you and construct a simple guide tree in order to perform the reconstruction. To do this, first switch 'Align extant sequences' to 'Yes' (see Figure 1.3a) which will, in turn, allow submission of a sequence library file (see Figure 1.3b). Your input library of sequences should be in FASTA format.</p>
                    <p>You should note that if you choose to use GRASP to align your library of sequences, the resulting alignment is unlikely to be as accurate as that produced by tools specifically developed for muliple sequence alignment. Some popular multiple sequence alignment tools/services are listed below:</p>

                    <p>A phylogenetic tree must be provided for standard reconstruction using 'Select phylogenetic tree file...' (see <a href="#home-img">(4)</a>). Accepted tree formats are noted above.</p>
                    <p>Some of the alignment tools listed above can provide phylogenetic trees. Alternatively, some tools/services/packages for generating trees are listed below:</p>

                    <p>GRASP can perform reconstruction based on a variety of evolutionary models which can be selected from the drop down menu 'Select other evolutionary model...' (see <a href="#home-img">(5)</a>). By default, JTT is used.</p>
                    <h3 id="Type-of-reconstruction">Type of reconstruction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Type-of-reconstruction"></a></h3>
                    <p>GRASP can perform both joint and marginal reconstructions. We suggest running joint reconstruction as the initial reconstruction (see <a href="#home-img">(6)</a>) as we have made marginal reconstruction available to be run on specific nodes in the results section of GRASP.</p>
                    <h3 id="Perform-reconstruction">Perform reconstruction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Perform-reconstruction"></a></h3>
                    <p>Once test data has been loaded or user data provided, the reconstruction can be started (see <a href="#home-img">(7)</a>).</p>
                    <h3 id="Problems">Problems<a class="anchor-link" href="#Problems"></a></h3><p>Once reconstruction has been started, you may be alerted to problems with your data. Error and warning messages are generally displayed within a textbox under the main input screen. They include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sequence names do not match the names of nodes in the phylogenetic tree. You will be notified of names that are unique for each file. GRASP will not guess what sequence that should be placed in the tree, so make sure the names agree in the two files. Some alignment programs will amend the names, which means you may need to edit them manually.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Your files will take a long time to process, or are too large for the web server. Contact us to download and install a local, commandline tool that you can run on your own hardware. This will not have the graphical user interface, however.</li>

                            <p>We provide the user with a visualisation of the phylogenetic tree that was provided for reconstruction. By default, extant labels are displayed and the user is given the option to also display or hide node labels and branch lengths (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(1)</a>, <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(2)</a> &amp; <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(3)</a>). The user can also switch between an additive tree type or a cladogram (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(4)</a>). This tree can also be saved as a png image (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(5)</a>).</p>
                            <p>Each node is coloured by evolutionary distance according to the legend on the left hand side (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(6)</a>). One node will always appear pink and be noted in the header above the tree. This is the node that is having its reconstruction displayed in the graph below the phylogenetic tree and is known as the <strong>primary node</strong>. By default, node N0 (the root node) is the <strong>primary node</strong> and will appear pink and be listed in the header.</p>

                            <p>By hovering over nodes in the tree, the name will be revealed. By right clicking a node in the tree you will bring up a number of operations which can be performed on the node.</p>

                            <p>GRASP uses partial-order graphs to display information about ancestors. They are suited to this task as (a) sequence homology amongst members in a protein family (and by extension their ancestors) may not always map unambiguously to a single, linear ordering, and (b) unresolved insertions and deletions can be identified as alternative paths through the graph.</p>
                            <p>The way you should read a partial-order graph is from left-to-right, node-by-node, forming a putative biological sequence (N- to C-terminus) by following a single path. At a single node there may be multiple out-edges, of which you can only select one. The choice is key, however.</p>
                            <h4 id="Edges-in-a-partial-order-graph-and-consensus-paths">Edges in a partial-order graph and consensus paths<a class="anchor-link" href="#Edges-in-a-partial-order-graph-and-consensus-paths"></a></h4>
                            <p><a id='edge_cons_paths'></a></p>
                            <p>An edge represent a valid path to construct a full-length sequence. Ultimately, once homologous sections have been determined by alignment, the set of extant sequences exemplify possible paths that can be taken. GRASP infers what edges go <em>in</em> to, as well as what edges go <em>out</em> from a node, by maximum parsimony. We call this process bi-directional edge-parsimony, and it is based on the phylogenetic tree.</p>
                            <p>GRASP identifies several different types of edges:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>dark edges are supported by bi-directional edge-parsimony; these links are strong candidates for how an ancestor can be assembled.<br></br></p>

For practical reasons, there is still a positional index to assist navigation in GRASP.</p>
                            <p>The node displays either a single character state or a distribution over possible character states. The states of ancestral nodes are inferred by maximum likelihood.</p>

                            <p><strong>Grey boxes</strong> Represent variations in insertions and deletions of the ancestor at the primary node that can not be resolved definitively; they indicate the presence of many edges in the ancestor at the corresponding position, all supported by maximum parsimony.</p>
                            <p><strong>Red circles</strong> Represent inferred deletions in the reconstructed sequence of the ancestor at the primary node; they represent positions where supported edges determine that deletions of one or more nodes have occurred.</p>

                            <p><strong>Joint</strong> -  GRASP infers the most probable combination of all ancestral states. The assignment of all ancestral states (across the whole phylogenetic tree) optimises a single objective (the state with the greatest <em>likelihood</em>). This will tell you which are the most probable ancestors, given the extant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The inference is valid for the whole tree, and it is practical to compare ancestors with one another as they represent snapshots in the same evolutionary history.</p>
                            <p><strong>Marginal</strong> - GRASP infers the probability distribution of each residue for a single, nominated ancestor. This inference will present you with the probability of amino acids at each position in the nominated ancestor, given extant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The inference "marginalises" all other ancestors, meaning that (a) each ancestor needs to be inferred separately, and (b) resulting distributions are not directly comparable; marginal reconstructions are based on the <em>same</em> input data, but allow for <em>different</em> versions of evolutionary histories along the <em>same</em> branches.</p>

                            <p>A marginal reconstruction allows the user to identify the positions that should be mutated with priority, to explore the space of probable ancestors.</p>
                            <p>Initially, the complexity of the mutant library is "1", suggesting for each position, only the most probable amino acid. At "2", a single mutation is allowed, at the position that improves the summed Kullback-Leibler divergence between the mutant distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions, across all sequence positions.
                                For each increase in the level, another position is identified where an alternative amino acid is suggested.</p>
