                    <p>GRASP infers ancestral proteins from homologous protein sequences. It efficiently determines character states, and the most supported insertions and deletions; GRASP presents all this as partial-order graphs using a visual interface, connected to a phylogenetic tree, with which the user can interact.</p>
                    <h3 id="input-data-nav">Input data</h3>
                    <p>GRASP requires only two input files and one parameter to run successfully. On GRASP's landing page, the two files you will require are a set of (aligned) sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree.</p>
                    <p>GRASP accepts the following file formats.</p>
                    <table class="table">
                        <thead><tr>
                            <th>Sequences</th>
                            <th>Alignment</th>
                            <th>Phylogenetic tree</th>
                        </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">FASTA</a></td>
                            <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">FASTA</a>, Clustal</td>

                        </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>To try GRASP out, on the landing page you are presented with the option of running test data (see <a href="#home-img">(1)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>).
                        This will automatically load an alignment file and tree file; you can then run joint (or marginal) reconstruction allowing you to explore the results provided by GRASP.
                        As we proceed through this tutorial, we will refer to the results of running the test data labelled 'Afriat-Jurnou et al. (29)'.
                        Data sets are taken from publications listed at the bottom of this page</p>
                    <h3>Help</h3>
                    <p>If, at any stage, you require specific information about what you are seeing presented on the GRASP home or results page,
                        you can hit the help button to switch on help boxes (see <a href="#home-img">(8)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>).</p>
                    <h3 id="job-name-nav">Name your job</h3>
                    <p>To allow you to keep track of your results, on the GRASP landing page you are able to provide a name for your job  (see <a href="#home-img">(2)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>). This name will be used as an identifier in any saved output data.</p>
                    <h3 id="align-seq-nav">Sequence alignment</h3>
                    <p>Once you have a name, you can 'Select sequence alignment file..' (see <a href="#home-img">(3)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>). Accepted alignment formats are noted in the table above.</p>
                    <h4>Align using GRASP</h4>
                    <p>If you do not have a set of aligned sequences, GRASP can align your sequences for you. To do this, first switch 'Align extant sequences' to 'Yes' (see <a href="#home-img">(3a)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>) which will, in turn, allow submission of a sequence library file (see <a href="#home-img">(3b)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>). Your input library of sequences should be in FASTA format.</p>
                    <p>While you can use GRASP to align your library of sequences, depending on your workflow, you may want to use any of the multiple sequence alignment tools/services listed below::</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We are currently working on a suite of tools that will perform advanced alignment and phylogenetic inference from only a set of homologous sequence; they will be available in GRASP once properly evaluated and benchmarked.</p>
                    <h3 id="phylo-tree-nav">Phylogenetic tree</h3>
                    <p>A phylogenetic tree must be provided for standard reconstruction using 'Select phylogenetic tree file...' (see <a href="#home-img">(4)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>). Accepted tree formats are noted above.</p>
                    <p>Some of the alignment tools listed above can provide phylogenetic trees. Alternatively, some tools/services/packages for generating trees are listed below:</p>

                    <h3 id="evol-model-nav">Evolutionary model</h3>
                    <p>GRASP can perform reconstruction based on a variety of evolutionary models which can be selected from the drop down menu 'Select other evolutionary model...' (see <a href="#home-img">(5)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>). By default, JTT is used.</p>
                    <h3 id="recon-type-nav">Type of reconstruction</h3>
                    <p>GRASP can perform both <a href="#technical-info">joint</a> and <a href="#technical-info">marginal</a> reconstructions. We suggest running joint reconstruction as the initial reconstruction (see <a href="#home-img">(6)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>) as we have made marginal reconstruction available to be run on specific nodes in the results section of GRASP.</p>
                    <h3 id="perform-recon-nav">Perform reconstruction</h3>
                    <p>Once test data has been loaded or user data provided, the reconstruction can be started (see <a href="#home-img">(7)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>).</p>
                    <h3 id="problems-nav">Problems</h3>
                    <p>Once reconstruction has been started, you may be alerted to problems with your data.
                        Error and warning messages are generally displayed within a text box under the main input screen. They include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sequence names do not match the names of nodes in the phylogenetic tree. You will be notified of names that are unique for each file. GRASP will not guess what sequence that should be placed in the tree, so make sure the names agree in the two files. Some alignment programs will amend the names, which means you may need to edit them manually.</li>
                        <li>Your sequences are composed of characters that are not recognised. The most common problem is the presence of an X character. We recommend that you try to identify a higher quality sequence without unknown amino acids.</li>
                        <li>Files are not correctly formatted or not in any of the accepted file formats. See above for what they are and follow links for how they store their content.</li>
                        <li>Your files will take a long time to process, or are too large for the web server. Contact us to download and install a local, commandline tool that you can run on your own hardware. This will not have the graphical user interface, however.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You should also be aware that the server only keeps the results for a limited time. You may notice that if you leave the results page open for a long time without interaction, it may stop responding.</p>

                            <p>The figures included in this section were generated by running the test data labelled 'Afriat-Jurnou et al. (29)' available on GRASP (see <a href="#home-img">(1)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>).</p>

                            <p>We provide the user with a visualisation of the phylogenetic tree that was provided for reconstruction. GRASP will number internal node labels from the root node (N0, N1, ...) using the principle of "depth first". By default, extant labels are displayed and the user is given the option to also display or hide node labels and branch lengths (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(1)</a>, <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(2)</a> &amp; <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(3)</a> in <a href="#phylo-tree-img">Figure 2</a>). The user can also switch between an additive tree type or a cladogram (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(4)</a> in <a href="#phylo-tree-img">Figure 2</a>). This tree can also be saved as a PNG image (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(5)</a> in <a href="#phylo-tree-img">Figure 2</a>).</p>
                            <p>Each node is coloured by evolutionary distance according to the legend on the left hand side (see <a href="#phylo-tree-img">(6)</a> in <a href="#home-img">Figure 1</a>). One node will always appear pink and be noted in the header above the tree. This is the node that is having its reconstruction displayed in the graph below the phylogenetic tree and is known as the <strong>primary node</strong>. By default, node N0 (the root node) is the <strong>primary node</strong> and will appear pink and be listed in the header.</p>

                            <h3 id="po-graph-nav">Partial-order graph</h3>
                            <p>GRASP uses partial-order graphs to display information about ancestors. They are suited to this task as (a) sequence homology amongst members in a protein family (and by extension their ancestors) may not always map unambiguously to a single, linear ordering, and (b) unresolved insertions and deletions can be identified as alternative paths through the graph.</p>
                            <p>We suggest that you read a partial-order graph is from left-to-right, node-by-node, forming a putative biological sequence (N- to C-terminus) by following a single path. While GRASP attempts to resolve the history of insertions and deletions, at a single node, you may be presented with multiple in- and out-going edges, each of which joins potential ancestral sequences together.</p>

                            <h4>Nodes in a partial-order graph</h4>
                            <p>A node simply represents the character state of a position in a sequence. The position is not defined in an absolute sense, rather in a relative sense when there is evidence of an order. For practical reasons, there is still a positional index to assist navigation in GRASP.</p>
                            <p>The node displays either a single character state or a distribution over possible character states. The states of ancestral nodes are inferred by maximum likelihood.</p>

                            <h4>Edges in a partial-order graph and consensus paths</h4>
                            <p><a id='edge_cons_paths'></a></p>
                            <p>An edge represents a valid path to create a full-length sequence. Ultimately, once homologous sections have been determined by alignment,
                                the set of extant sequences express the space of possible paths that can be taken. Of them, by enumerating them at each node,
                                GRASP infers the maximally <em>parsimonious</em> edges, i.e. the edge or edges that imply the least number of changes across the whole evolutionary history.
                                We call this process <em>bi-directional edge-parsimony</em> (BDEP). The term "bi-directional" here refers to the separation of in- and out-going edges of a node,
                                and therefore an edge can be maximally parsimonious, for one or both nodes it joins. You can find a more detailed explanation <a href="#technical-info">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>GRASP identifies edges for which there is qualified support, and makes a number of distinctions that are important to interpret sequences that you assemble through them:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Dark-coloured edges are fully supported by bi-directional edge-parsimony; these links are strong candidates for how an ancestor can be assembled.
                                        They are not exclusive; multiple paths connecting different parts of a full-length sequence may be present.
                                        Nor are they guaranteed to identify even a single full-length sequence.<br></br></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>A light-coloured edge is maximally parsimonious when only one of the nodes it joins is considered.
                                        These edges are weaker candidates but are kept to allow full-length ancestors to be formulated in the absence of the stronger option above.</p>

                            <p>GRASP also has access to the raw number of extant sequences on which the inference is based. This can be used to separate edges further:</p>

                                    <p>Dashed edges have only a single representative in the set of extant sequences; these should almost always be disregarded and are often the result of out-groups that have been used to build the phylogenetic tree.</p>

                                    <p>GRASP provides the option of displaying one <em>consensus</em> sequence. If this option is turned on,
                                        thick/bold edges represent a single, consensus traversal of the graph, giving (greedy) preference to

                            <h4>Navigation bar</h4>
                            <p>The navigation bar has a blue box (see <a href="#graph-view-img">(4)</a> in <a href="#graph-view-img">Figure 4</a>) which can be expanded, or collapsed and moved across the window to view different sections of the graphs. The region of the graph that you are viewing is within the blue box. Depending on which node is being viewed as the <strong>primary node</strong> (see <a href="#phylogenetic_tree">Phylogenetic tree</a>) you will see grey boxes and red circles across the navigation bar.</p>
                            <p><strong>Grey boxes</strong> represent variations in insertions and deletions of the ancestor at the primary node that can not be resolved definitively; they indicate the presence of two or more edges in the ancestor at the corresponding position, all supported by maximum parsimony.</p>
                            <p><strong>Red circles</strong> represent inferred deletions in the reconstructed sequence of the ancestor at the primary node, relative to the multiple sequence alignment graph; they represent positions where supported edges determine that deletions of one or more nodes have occurred.</p>
                            <h4>Multiple sequence alignment</h4>
                            <p>The multiple sequence alignment is represented here as a partial-order alignment graph which captures variation across all sequences. Each node in the graph is represented as a pie chart showing the distribution of amino acids at that position across all extant sequences. The most probable amino acid is shown using its one-letter code. When you hover your mouse over each node, a bar chart will display, showing the distribution in more detail, as seen in <a href="#msa-pie-chart-img">Figure 5</a>.</p>
                            <a id="msa-pie-chart-img"></a>

                            <h4>Primary node reconstruction</h4>
                            <p>This graph displays the reconstructed partial-order graph of the primary node. More technical information of joint reconstruction is provided <a href="#technical-info">below</a>.</p>
                            <p>Edges in reconstructions are inferred by edge-parsimony. One or more ancestral sequences can be formed by following one path. We recommend that dark edges are given preference, but all presented edges have some support. We recommend that dashed edges are not used as their support is based only on a single sequence (usually representing an out-group). As a last guide, but only if you really want a single sequence, use bold edges as they indicate the path which has the greatest number of extant sequences supporting.</p>
                            <h4>The joint reconstruction stack and the merged reconstruction</h4>
                            <p>When the 'Add joint reconstruction' option is selected for a node in the phylogenetic tree, its reconstructed sequence will be added below the sequence of the primary node (boxed with a blue shade that indicates the evolutionary distance of the phylogenetic node it is taken from to the root). We refer to this as the "stack" and you can keep adding joint reconstructions to it; this allows for comparisons between ancestral states at different phylogenetic nodes.</p>
                            <p>On addition to the aligned visualisation of reconstructions in the stack, a graphical representation of all the ancestral graphs in a "merged" format will appear at the bottom of the graph visualisation as seen in <a href="#merged-graph-img">Figure 6</a>. The character state of each individual graph is displayed as a slice in a pie graph of all the ancestral graphs. Note that the colour of the outline indicates the evolutionary distance to the root, just as the background of the panel where the graph is shown.</p>

                            <p>The graph visualisation can be reset so only the reconstruction of the primary node is displayed (see <a href="#graph-view-img">(8)</a> in <a href="#graph-view-img">Figure 4</a>).</p>

                            <p>Once a marginal reconstruction has been performed, it is possible to identify targets for mutational analysis. This is based on the idea that the reconstruction represents just one possible ancestor, and that others can be explored around it by mutating positions that are inferred to be in an ambivalent state.</p>
                            <p>The user can select the level of complexity of the mutant library.
                                The base case "0" means that all nodes map to the single, most probable amino acid.
                                You will note by setting it to "0" all nodes become single-state.
                                By increasing the level, alternative amino acids are added to positions that are more ambivalent;
                                at higher levels of complexity, some positions are assigned two or more mutational targets.
                                An arrow appears close to the location of the identified nodes.
                                You will note that the ambivalent nodes are shown with more character states.

                            <h3 id="joint-marg-nav">What is the difference between joint and marginal reconstruction?</h3>
                            <p>GRASP employs exact probabilistic inference; it distinguishes between two types of reconstructions:</p>
                            <p><strong>Joint</strong> - GRASP infers the most probable combination of all ancestral states.
                                The assignment of all ancestral states (across the whole phylogenetic tree) optimises a single objective
                                (the joint state with the greatest <em>likelihood</em>).
                                This will tell you which are the most probable ancestors, given the extant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships.
                                The inference is valid for the whole tree, and it is practical to compare ancestors with one another as they represent
                                snapshots from the same evolutionary history.</p>
                            <p><strong>Marginal</strong> - GRASP infers the probability distribution of each residue for a single, nominated ancestor.
                                This inference will present you with the probability of amino acids at each position in the nominated ancestor,
                                given extant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The inference "marginalises" all other ancestors,
                                which means that (a) each ancestor needs to be inferred separately, and (b) resulting distributions are not directly comparable.
                                Multiple marginal reconstructions (for different ancestors) are based on the <em>same</em> input data, but their mutual consistency is not enforced;
                                they allow for <em>different</em> versions of evolutionary histories along the <em>same</em> branches.</p>
                            <p>Once GRASP performs a joint reconstruction it will determine and keep all ancestral states in memory; this process can take some time to complete.
                                "Adding" nodes on the results page will not require more inference of ancestral states, so the delay you experience is minor.
                                Marginal reconstruction needs to be performed for each node; inference is separate so there will be longer delays each time

                            <p>Edges represent optional paths through which sequences can be composed;
                                ultimately, the collective of extant sequences when aligned determines the set of all possible paths;
                                that set is the source from which we draw the path or paths for any ancestor.
                                We are interested in identifying which edges that are best supported for an ancestor, given their phylogenetic relationships.
                                For this we use the basic principle of maximum parsimony, where only the most parsimonious edges are kept for each individual ancestor.</p>
                            <p>Maximum parsimony is applied to edges of a node; for each node, we separately process edges labelled by the nodes preceding it, and edges labelled by the nodes following it.
                                An edge can therefore be supported in one direction but not the other.
                                Uni-directional support is sufficient for GRASP to display an edge and maintain any paths to the nodes concerned;
                                bi-directional support should be seen as a much stronger endorsement though.
                                We run maximum parsimony to identify <em>all</em> edges that achieve the best score (the same score can be shared by multiple edge selections).
                                This means that in many cases multiple paths through an ancestor cannot be ruled out.</p>

                            <h3 id="mutant-nav">How are mutant libraries determined?</h3>
                            <p>A marginal reconstruction allows the user to identify the positions that should be mutated with priority, to explore the space of probable ancestors.</p>
                            <p>Initially, the complexity of the mutant library is "0", suggesting for each position, only the most probable amino acid.
                                At "1", a single mutation is allowed, at the position that best improves the summed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler divergence</a> between the
                                mutant distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions, across all sequence positions.
                                For each increase in the level, another mutation is identified where an alternative amino acid is suggested.
                                Note that additional mutations could occur at a position that has been mutated previously or in a different position.
                                Either way, the potential library will increase in complexity, i.e. increase the number of theoretically possible mutants.
