Description: This package takes output from ASRPOG.jar which performs an ancestral reconstruction 
    given sequences or a multiple sequence alignment and corresponding phylogenetic tree. Output includes a 
    newly labelled phylogenetic tree and an alignment including reconstructed sequence (if joint 
    inference was performed) and a distribution file (if marginal inference was performed).
    All three files have associated functions to read and plot the output data.
