# Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction

## Description
This is the main repository for the GRASP-suite -- a (web-based) toolkit for ancestral sequence reconstruction.

See http://grasp.scmb.uq.edu.au. GRASP-suite depends heavily on bnkit (https://github.com/bodenlab/bnkit) for performing phylogenetic inference.

## Development
Get in contact with someone at the Boden lab, see http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au or http://grasp.scmb.uq.edu.au.
